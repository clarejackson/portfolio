Being an FST, she is knowledgeable regarding current issues, and as an OS, she is willing to get things done. Lately she has been challenging herself to do more plan ahead work to set a schedule for work we know that needs to be done and being flexible enough to handle the extras that pop-up. She has done an amazing job of balancing life and work during the pandemic and consistently rises to the task. I could not succeed without her. Clare is a shining example of our company goals of Better Together, Determined, Passionate and Creative. Thank you to everything that you do!",
